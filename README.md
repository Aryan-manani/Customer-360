# Customer-360

Customer buy the policy from the bank and the information is stored by the bank in the servers and whenever the customer contact bank for the policy details it is the job of the bank to provide the correct details to them. So they hire agents who would talk to the customer on the phone and provide the policy details to them by asking their policy number. Hence there was a need to create a module that organizes the information about the policy details and has a functionality to search the details based on the policy number provided by the customer to the agent.
